        <p>Hello! My name is Brandan.</p>  
        
        <p>Currently, I am studying Computer Science at <a href="http://www.smc.edu/Pages/Home.aspx" id="SMC">Santa Monica College</a> in Santa Monica, California, who is obsessed with using computers to solve real world problems. I was born in <a href="http://www.comptoncity.org" id="compton">Compton, California</a> and will be the first person in my family to graduate college. In late 2018, I was accepted into my college <a href="http://www.smc.edu/StudentServices/Scholars/About-Scholars/Pages/What-is-Scholars.aspx" id="SMC">Scholars/Honors</a> program, which is a program that allows me to take reserved university level courses.</p>
 
        <p>I am also a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/stem_on_station/ncas_microalgae/ncas/index.html" id="nasa">NASA Community College Aerospace Scholar</a>, <a href="https://www.aap.ucla.edu/units/cccp/#welcome" id="ucla">UCLA CCCP Scholar</a>, and a recipient of two scholarships, the <a href="https://williamhgross.com/foundation/" id="scholarship">Sue and Bill Gross CTE<a/> and <a href="https://santamonicacollegefoundation.org/scholarships.php" id="scholarship">Richard A. Gross Memorial</a> Scholarship.</p>

        <p>I have taken courses at my current college that teaches C, C++, and Python. Outside of school, I taught myself how to program using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and have made a few projects on <a href="https://codepen.io/brandanherron/" id="codepen">Codepen</a>. If interested, contact me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandan-herron/" id="linkedin">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:brandanherron@icloud.com" id="email">Email</a> :-)</p>
